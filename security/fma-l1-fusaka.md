## Introduction

This document is intended to be shared in a public space for reviews and visibility purposes. It covers Upgrade 16b, which involves the following changes:

- (`op-batcher`) Ability to submit cell proof blob sidecars (not just blob proof sidecars)
- (Consensus Layer) Ability to compute an accurate reflection of the L1 Blob Base Fee on L2, even when L1 activates Blob Parameter Only forks.
- (Smart Contracts) For chains using Fault Proofs, L1 contracts updates which reference an updated absolute prestate hash.

Each change has its own section below with a list of Failure Modes.

## Failure Modes and Recovery Paths

### FM1: `op-batcher` release not rolled out in time

- **Description:**  
  There is a chance we don't ship the changes we need to `op-batcher` before the forks activate on L1.  
  Also a problem if node or chain operators fail to update in time, even if our releases are available.  
  The impact would be a safe head stall and sequencer window expiry / reorg if the L1 rejects the batcher's blob transactions.  
  This can happen even in the patched batcher, if a config flag is not flipped.

- **Risk Assessment:** High severity, Medium Likelihood
- **Mitigations:**
  - Get a basic release candidate ready as early as possible
  - Communicate widely and clearly about the need to update and any live ops that need to happen
  - Check with L1 nodes on already forked networks: do they accept legacy batcher blob transactions?
  
- **Detection:**
  - Usual alerts and dashboards
- **Recovery Path(s):** 
  - Even an old batcher can switch to calldata as a good mitigation

---

### FM2a: `op-node` or `kona` node release not rolled out in time (blob verification)

- **Description:**  
  There is a chance we don't ship the changes we need to `op-node` or `kona` before the forks activate on L1.  
  Changes to the beacon API https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/?urls.primaryName=dev are breaking with respect
  to the current op-node, op-program and kona. All three rely on the `/eth/v1/beacon/blob_sidecars` API which is being
  deprecated. It will be replaced with `/eth/v1/beacon/blobs`, which has the notable difference that it does 
  not return KZG commitments or KZG blob proofs (see [EIP 4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)). The
  affected components will be updated to i) pull blobs from the new endpoint once it is available and ii) perform
  blob verification _without_ the aid of a KZG proof. If either fix fails to deploy in time there would be a
  safe head stall and possible eventual sequencer window expiry.

- **Risk Assessment:** Medium severity, Medium Likelihood  
- **Mitigations:**
  - Prepare release candidate early and test on L1-Fusaka-enabled devnets
  - Communicate clearly about upgrade requirements
  
- **Detection:**
  - Usual monitoring / alerts
- **Recovery Path(s):** 
  - Switch the batcher to use calldata

### FM2c: `op-node` or `kona` node release not rolled out in time (blob base fee calculation)

- **Description:**  
  There is a chance we don't ship the changes we need to `op-node` or `kona` before the forks activate on L1.  
  For example, the code we need to patch `op-node` exists in go-ethereum, but is only released late in the development cycle.  
  Also a problem if node or chain operators fail to update in time, even if our releases are available.  

  The impact would be:
  - Incorrect blob base fee → L2 users overcharged
  - Possible denial of service due to high L2 fees
  - Chain split if nodes update uncoordinatedly

  We have seen this failure mode [play out on Sepolia](https://www.notion.so/oplabs/OP-Sepolia-L1-Cost-Blob-Schedule-Bug-1adf153ee1628009b429ee10828fb300#1adf153ee1628009b429ee10828fb300), requiring a hardfork to fix.  

  With the current blob parameter schedule, only BPO1 causes the problem, not Fusaka itself.

- **Risk Assessment:** High severity, Medium Likelihood  
- **Mitigations:**
  - Prepare release candidate early
  - Communicate clearly about upgrade requirements
  - Take extra care in the *next* upstream merge of `op-geth` (post-Fusaka) for consensus changes
  
- **Detection:**
  - Obvious if releases aren’t shipped on time
- **Recovery Path(s):** 
  - One-off fork may be needed to fix chain split

---

### FM3: Lagging behind upstream Geth

- **Description:**  
  We decided to delay updating `op-geth` with Fusaka changes, to avoid forced Go 1.24 adoption.  
  This is lower risk since L2 does not adopt Fusaka directly. However, we may miss bug/security patches upstream.  

- **Risk Assessment:** High severity, Low Likelihood
- **Mitigations:**
  - Thoroughly review the skipped upstream merge for critical patches
  - Take extra care in the next merge post-Fusaka  
- **Detection:**
  - Immunefi report or an exploit
- **Recovery Path(s):**
  - Cherry-pick missing fixes into `op-geth`

---

### FM4: New chain deployments consume more than 16,777,216 gas

- **Description:**  
 EIP [7825](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7825) introduces a
 per-transaction gas cap, which our standard deployment 
 might well exceed (especially with more dispute game types being deployed).

- **Risk Assessment:** Low severity, High Likelihood
- **Mitigations:**
  - Deploy before Fusaka goes live (only works for a short time)
  - Avoid expanding the set of standard contracts deployed
  - Tune the "padding" we apply in `op-deployer` (see https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/pull/17710)
  - Rearchitect the deployment script to break up the transaction into several smaller transactions
- **Detection:**
  - Obvious, deployment transaction reverts
- **Recovery Path(s):**
  - N/A

## Generic Items

This upgrade is an unnamed L2 hardfork, activated by an L1 hardfork: so the items in [fma-generic-hardfork.md](./fma-generic-hardfork.md) apply:

- Chain Halt at activation  
- Invalid absolute prestate provided.  
- Chain split across clients  

- [x] Confirm these items have been considered and updated if necessary.
