## Introduction

This document covers the initial deployment of [the Asterisc Fault Proof VM][asterisc] with [the Kona Fault Proof Program][kona].

Together, Kona and Asterisc form an alternative proof stack to the [op-program] and [cannon].
A secondary dispute game will be created that uses kona and asterisc.
The [op-challenger] supports playing _both_ game types - `op-program` + `cannon` as well as `kona` + `asterisc`.

Stage 1.4 ships these two new net components: [Kona Fault Proof Program][kona] and the [Asterisc Fault Proof VM][asterisc].
Both of these introduce points of failure that are covered in the Failure Modes and Recovery Paths below.

Stage 1.4 also requires the integration of the Kona + Asterisc Dispute Game into the [op-challenger] offchain
fault proof component. The Failure Modes and Recovery Paths below detail this as well.

## Failure Modes and Recovery Paths

### Kona and Asterisc Hot Path Failure

- **Description:**
  The `op-program` + `cannon` dispute game breaks and the `kona` + `asterisc` fault dispute game is placed in the hot path.
  If `kona` + `asterisc` also fail, the permissioned fallback will need to be activated.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  Low likelihood, high impact.
  Low likelihood since `op-program` + `cannon` are already running in production and have meaningful improvements on the way that will increase resilience.
  If `kona` + `asterisc` fails while in the hotpath, the impact is high since the permissioned fallback will need to be triggered.
  This engages the deputy guardian, requires comms, and causes the chain to fallback to a weaker security model.

- **Mitigations:**
  Offline testing with the VM Runner for both `kona` + `asterisc` as well as `op-program` + `cannon`.
  The VM Runner also fully tests the integration of the `op-challenger` with these dispute games ([covered in a later section](#Breaking-Backwards-Compatibility-for-the-op-challenger)).
  Action tests ensuring both proof systems follow spec.
  * [VM Runner Instance (Private OP Labs Infra)](https://optimistic.grafana.net/d/bdtk5xud0cg00e/vm-runner?from=now-24h&to=now&timezone=browser&var-namespace=$__all)
  * [Shared Action Tests](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-e2e/actions/proofs)
    * [Kona's CI Job for Action Tests](https://github.com/anton-rs/kona/actions/workflows/action_tests.yaml)
  * [Extensive Unit Testing in `kona` (>90% coverage)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/anton-rs/kona)
  * [Unit testing in `asterisc`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/asterisc/tree/master/tests)

- **Detection:**
  The game that broke `op-program` + `cannon` would be invalidated since the respected game type would be switched in the dispute game factory.
  Once `kona` + `asterisc` is the respected game type, the dispute monitor will watch for all new games and will alert if there is an issue with `kona` + `asterisc`.
  If `kona` + `asterisc` has an issue while in the hot path, and an invalid output / game is played, the dispute monitor and `op-challenger` would alert and detect invalid games.
  At this point, the permissioned fallback would need to be engaged since both proof systems are in repair.

- **Recovery Path(s):**
  Likely the only viable recovery path would be the permissioned fallback unless the `op-program` + `cannon` are fixed and able to be placed back into the hotpath.


### Divergent Kona Derivation Pipeline

- **Description:**
  The `kona` derivation pipeline diverged in behavior from the `op-program`'s derivation pipeline.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  Low likelihood, low impact.
  Low likelihood as the derivation pipeline is extensively unit tested, run in the VM Runner, and is action tested.
  Low impact since by default `kona` + `asterisc` are placed in the cold path.
  [The "Kona and Asterisc Hot Path Failure"](#Kona-and-Asterisc-Hot-Path-Failure) above covers the failure mode for `kona` + `asterisc` when placed in the hot path.

- **Mitigations:**
  Action tests covering the derivation pipeline are run on every pull request in the [kona] repository.
  VM Runner executes the derivation pipeline as part of the kona fault proof program running on top of asterisc.
  [Extensive test coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/anton-rs/kona/tree/main/crates) of kona.

    * [Kona's CI Job for Action Tests](https://github.com/anton-rs/kona/actions/workflows/action_tests.yaml)
  * [Extensive Unit Testing in `kona` (>90% coverage)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/anton-rs/kona)

- **Detection:**
  The VM runner would pick up an issue.
  The action tests or local testing may pick up an issue.
  Use of the derivation elsewhere, for example in alternative consensus clients like `op-rs`, would pick up an issue.
    - _Note_: `op-rs` is not yet serving as a source of detection. In the coming months, it will provide more coverage
      over `kona`'s derivation pipeline.

- **Recovery Path(s):**
  Fix the derivation pipeline divergence, release and deploy the updated kona + asterisc when in the coldpath.
  If `kona` + `asterisc` is placed in the hotpath, the system operator would either need to fall back to `op-program` and `cannon`, or fall back to the permissioned dispute game.
  [The "Kona and Asterisc Hot Path Failure"](#Kona-and-Asterisc-Hot-Path-Failure) above covers the failure mode for `kona` + `asterisc` when placed in the hot path.


### Kona Execution Diverges from op-program

- **Description:**
  The Kona Fault Proof Program executes blocks in a stateless L2 block executor that uses optimism-revm as a backend.
  If optimism-revm or the L2 block executor diverge in behavior from the `op-program`, the `kona` + `asterisc` proof system will be invalid.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  Low likelihood, low impact.
  A small divergence in execution behavior can cause invalid game results.
  But since kona + asterisc is in the coldpath, it doesn't have impact on anything in the production system.

- **Mitigations:**
  State testing against op-revm.
  Action tests covering the L2 block executor are run on every pull request in the [kona] repository.
  `op-reth` which uses the same op-execution environment as `kona`.

  * [Shared Action Tests](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-e2e/actions/proofs)
    * [Kona's CI Job for Action Tests](https://github.com/anton-rs/kona/actions/workflows/action_tests.yaml)
  * [Extensive Unit Testing in `kona` (>90% coverage)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/anton-rs/kona)

- **Detection:**
  Running `op-reth` so it's synced and following tip would provide a way to watch for chain splits.
  A chain split occuring means `kona`'s execution (the same as `op-reth`) diverges from the `op-program`.

- **Recovery Path(s):**
  If `kona` + `asterisc` is in the coldpath, it would need to be fixed and re-deployed.
  If `op-program` + `cannon` cannot be placed in the hotpath, and `kona` + `asterisc` fails, the permissioned fallback must be engaged.
  [The "Kona and Asterisc Hot Path Failure"](#-Kona-and-Asterisc-Hot-Path-Failure) above covers the failure mode for `kona` + `asterisc` when placed in the hot path.


### Breaking Backwards Compatibility for the op-challenger

- **Description:**
  The `op-challenger` has been updated to support the Kona + Asterisc Fault Dispute Game type ([Game Type 3]).

- **Risk Assessment:**
  Low likelihood as the action tests that are run in CI very frequently run the `op-challenger` with the `kona` + `asterisc` fault dispute game.
  Medium impact since the off-chain `op-challenger` service can be updated with enough buffer time due to the large game time and nature of the chess clock.

- **Mitigations:**
  The `op-challenger` is architected in such a way as to isolate game types and more so the individual game players.
  To allow the challenger to scale and play many different game types at once, a list of game types to play is passed into the `op-challenger` as a CLI flag.
  When games are detected on-chain, the `op-challenger` will create a "game player" for this game type.
  Players are run in individual threads so a breaking `kona` + `asterisc` game player in the challenger will not cause a liveness issue for the `op-challenger` to play other game types.
  Another key mitigation is the VM runner. This is an offline simulation that runs asterisc + kona with the op-challenger. It's been running since around August 2024.

  * [Shared Action Tests (Using `op-challenger` code to execute programs)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-e2e/actions/proofs)
    * [Kona's CI Job for Action Tests](https://github.com/anton-rs/kona/actions/workflows/action_tests.yaml)

- **Detection:**
  The Dispute Monitor ([op-dispute-mon] service provides an isolated monitoring service that will detect if a game is not being played by the honest `op-challenger`.
  It will alert in this case.

- **Recovery Path(s):**
  If the `op-challenger` fails to play `kona` + `asterisc` fault dispute games, a fix will need to be made to the `op-challenger`.
  It does not require governance, but would need a new release of the `op-challenger` to be published and rolled out to infrastructure.

### Divergence between RISCV.sol and Asterisc

- **Description:**
  Asterisc is a "Fault Proof VM".
  It is an onchain RISCV instruction emulator with the on-chain component of the kona + asterisc fault dispute game being the `RISCV.sol` contract.
  `RISCV.sol` runs a single RISCV instruction on chain with merkleized VM memory.
  Effectively, the behavior between `RISCV.sol` and asterisc cannot diverge.

- **Risk Assessment:**
  Low likelihood, but high impact.

- **Mitigation:**
  Heavily test `RISCV.sol`. Audit `RISCV.sol`.
  Asterisc already runs through action tests frequently in CI validiting that it produces the expected output.

  * [Differential tests between the native and solidity implementations of Asterisc](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/asterisc/blob/df0d2cc9f769fef8eec41273931d8e8fd09e65dd/rvgo/test/vm_test.go#L177)
  * [Unit testing in `asterisc`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/asterisc/tree/master/tests)

- **Detection:**
  Since `op-dispute-mon` uses the same asterisc backend that the `op-challenger` does, there may be divergent behaviour between asterisc and `RISCV.sol`.
  In the worst case, if a silent issue is exploited in `RISCV.sol`, a fault dispute game may resolve incorrectly.
  But since the kona + asterisc fault dispute game lives outside the hotpath, this game result is not used anywhere by the portal and can be discarded.

- **Recovery Path(s):**
  If a divergence between `RISCV.sol` and asterisc is found, either or both would need to be updated, and re-released.
  Since the kona + asterisc Fault Dispute Game would need to use the updated `RISCV.sol`, if it was fixed, an upgrade would need to be performed.
  If the kona + asterisc fault dispute game sits in the hotpath, the security council would need to fallback to the op-program + cannon fault dispute
  game, and only switch back once the fix has been released and deployed.


### Generic items we need to take into account:

- [X] [./failure-modes-analysis.md](./failure-modes-analysis.md).
- [X] [`DisputeGameFactory.setImplementation`](./fma-generic-hardfork.md#invalid-disputegamefactorysetimplementation-execution) (in [./fma-generic-hardfork.md](./fma-generic-hardfork.md))
  - **Mitigations:**
    - This upgrade does not place the new implementation into the hot path of the bridge. The new `FaultDisputeGame` will
      not influence any other contract in the protocol.
- [X] [./fma-generic-contracts.md](./fma-generic-contracts.md)
  - [**Proxy Initialization Failure**](./fma-generic-contracts.md#proxy-initialization-failure)
    - **Mitigations**
      - The re-initialization of the `AnchorStateRegistry` for this upgrade does not change any existing storage slots
        within the `AnchorStateRegistry` proxy. It will only initialize a new slot for the `ASTERISC_KONA` game type's
        prestate hash.
      - Tests on the `superchain-ops` upgrade scripts for the upgrade's expected post-state.
    - **Detection**
      - Failure of the `superchain-ops` upgrade script's post-state checks, with state-diff exclusion tests for
        undeclared storage.
  - [**Proxy Initialized to Wrong Values**](./fma-generic-contracts.md#proxy-initialized-to-wrong-values)
    - **Mitigations**
      - Tests on the `superchain-ops` upgrade scripts for the upgrade's expected post-state.
    - **Detection**
      - Failure of the `superchain-ops` upgrade script's post-state checks, with state-diff exclusion tests for
        undeclared storage.
  - _All other `fma-generic-contracts` failure modes do not apply to this upgrade_

## Audit Requirements

The `RISCV.sol` contract will need an audit for mainnet, though no audit is required for testnet.
The audit document will be handled separately from this FMA.
