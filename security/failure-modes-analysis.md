# Purpose

The goal of this document is to ensure project teams understand the importance of a Failure Modes Analysis (FMA) and know how to complete a thorough analysis.

# Summary

An FMA is intended to shift-left the process of thinking through the risks associated with a project, so that mitigations can be planned for and implemented earlier rather than later.

# Problem Statement + Context

The FMA process aims to reduce unforeseen risks and failures in projects by providing a structured approach to identifying and mitigating potential failure modes early in the project lifecycle.

# Alternatives Considered

**Freeform Risk Assessment**: Project teams conduct risk assessments as-needed, without a standardized template or process. This approach is less time-consuming but may result in inconsistent and/or incomplete analyses.

**Comprehensive Risk Framework**: Using an established process such as the [NIST Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf) ensures all aspects of the risk management life cycle are covered. While thorough, this approach requires significant time and resources to implement.

# Proposed Solution

The [FMA Template](../assets/fma-template.md) has been successfully used as the standard approach for conducting risk assessments on many projects because it:

- Provides a simple structure for identifying and analyzing failure modes, assessing their risk, and developing mitigations and recovery paths.
- Strikes a balance between the two alternatives above to ensure the risk management process adds value.

To use this [FMA Template](../assets/fma-template.md), create a copy of it wherever appropriate.
Read through the full template before making any changes, as it is self-documenting and provides guidance on how to complete each section.

# Risks & Uncertainties

**Adoption**: It is up to project teams to determine if and when an FMA is necessary, and ensure it is completed thoroughly.

**Time Constraints**: Depending on the size of the project, completing an FMA and the action items that result from it may require significant time and effort. This could lead to delays in project timelines, or a suboptimal FMA to ensure timelines are met.
