## Purpose

<!-- This section is also sometimes called “Motivations” or “Goals”. -->

<!-- It is fine to remove this section from the final document,
but understanding the purpose of the doc when writing is very helpful. -->

## Summary

<!-- Most (if not all) documents should have a summary.
While the length will likely be proportional to the length of the full document,
the summary should be as succinct as possible. -->

## Problem Statement + Context

<!-- Describe the specific problem that the document is seeking to address as well
as information needed to understand the problem and design space.
If more information is needed on the costs of the problem,
this is a good place to that information. -->

## Proposed Solution

<!-- A high level overview of the proposed solution.
When there are multiple alternatives there should be an explanation
of why one solution was picked over other solutions.
As a rule of thumb, including code snippets (except for defining an external API)
is likely too low level. -->

### Resource Usage

<!-- What is the resource usage of the proposed solution?
Does it consume a large amount of computational resources or time? -->

### Single Point of Failure and Multi Client Considerations

<!-- Details on how this change will impact multiple clients. Do we need to plan for changes to both op-geth and op-reth? -->

## Failure Mode Analysis

<!-- Link to the failure mode analysis document, created from the fma-template.md file. -->

## Impact on Developer Experience
<!-- Does this proposed design change the way application developers interact with the protocol?
Will any Superchain developer tools (like Supersim, templates, etc.) break as a result of this change? -->

## Alternatives Considered

<!-- List out a short summary of each possible solution that was considered.
Comparing the effort of each solution -->

## Risks & Uncertainties

<!-- An overview of what could go wrong.
Also any open questions that need more work to resolve. -->
