- **Proposed Version:** _[e.g., 0.8.25]_

## Benefits to the OP Stack

_Explain specific feature(s) in the new version that would benefit the OP Stack codebase, with a
clear explanation of their potential impact and usefulness._

codebase and the proposed new version._

## Action Items

_Highlight what **needs** to be done/reviewed before implementation to reduce the chances of the issues occurring, and to ensure they can be detected and recovered from:_

- [ ] _Resolve all comments on this document and incorporate them into the document itself (Assignee: document author)_
